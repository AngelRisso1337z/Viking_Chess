# Viking_Chess
ancient chess-like game, made as a practice project

the point of the game is for the king (the K piece) to get to the edges, meanwhile, the attacking team,represented as X, 
has to kill the king.The only movements you can do are vertical and horizoltal. You cannot land or jump over other units. 
this game as stated, was made for an University Practice Project (UPP). feel free to change the code
if you so desire. the only missing feature from the base project is being unable to jump over enemy units.
